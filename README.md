# WSO2-GDS-Integration

This repository contains an experimental integration project using **WSO2 Micro Integrator**. The objective was to orchestrate services from multiple **GDS (Global Distribution System) suppliers** into a unified interface, enabling streamlined access and enhanced scalability for travel-related applications.

> тЪая╕П Note: This project was a proof of concept and was not fully completed. However, it reflects the early-stage design and implementation efforts toward building a flexible integration layer.
